Thanks

Thanks for the author of "Mastering Algorithms with C", since almost all of the code come from the book.
And I try to pull the code to the github for easy learning and hacking.

Contents

   include

      This directory contains all of the header files contained and referenced
      in the book. Every file is named the same as in the book.

   source

      This directory contains all of the source files found in the book. Every
      file is named the same as in the book.

   examples

      This directory contains source code not found in the book. This code may
      be useful for experimenting with the book's code. The directory contains
      a number of subdirectories, each addressing a specific topic. Each topic
      has one or more examples (called ex-1.c, ex-2.c, etc.). Each example has
      a makefile named according to the topic addressed by the executable that
      the makefile builds. Note that small changes to a makefile may be needed
      to account for compiler differences, the make variant being applied, and
      other idiosyncracies on some systems; makefiles are provided mainly as a
      reference for which source files must be compiled and which objects must
      be linked in order to make use of certain data structures or algorithms,
      etc.
